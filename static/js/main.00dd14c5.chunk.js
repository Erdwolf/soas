In a 4-player game it is enough if at least one player collects the flower to make the corresponding \u201ecarabus\u2018s flower\u201c accessible for the other players. From this time there can be two laces in the given \u201ccarabus\u2019s flower\u201d.

You will probably want to take a flower in the colour assigned to the cricket only towards the end of the game. This is because after collecting it, you immediately collect another two flowers and the game ends for you. Even if you still have a lace. It means you make a last triple move. When collecting the last two flowers you still have to respect the effect of other animals. It is also possible that by taking the first flower, you make the second one inaccessible.

A flower with two laces can\xb4t be collected anymore. If the collected flower is also a\xa0\u201clocust\u2019s one\u201d, this effect trigers again.

In this case return to collecting unoccupied flowers while your opponent can collect only the ones with a lace in them. Even though the tarantula makes you to collect flowers which already contain a lace, there can\xb4t be more than two laces at once in any flower.

In this way the flower with the lowest number of petals becomes accessible first. By collecting more \u201cstick insect\u2019s flowers\u201d you make flowers with a higher number of petals accessible. In order to make the flower with the highest number of petals accessible, all four \u201cstick insect\u2019s flowers\u201d have to be collected first.

When pulling flowers out due to some animals, you pull only the end of the lace you currently play with, so you can\u2019t pull out the lace behind the knot.
